Welcome to my research website.

## Project overview

This project investigates the viability of utilizing matrix analysis to better predict phenotypes. By comparing traditional univariate to multivariate analysis of trait prediction it can be determined if prediction is more reliable using one of these methods.

## Analysis

Here we present the reproducible the results of our analyses. They were 
generated by rendering
the [R Markdown documents](https://github.com/kcoyne998/CoyneProject) into webpages.

The results presented in the paper were produced with these analyses.
